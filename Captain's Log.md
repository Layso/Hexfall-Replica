-------------------
- Hex selection mechanic implemented
- Each touch on same hexagon will make it select its next 2 neighboor (towards clockwise direction)
- A touch on a different hexagon will reset direction counter which selects first set of hexagons (pivot, up, up-left)
- A function implemented to specify which hexagons are selected currently by outlining them
- Performance improvements can be done due to massive object creation and component creation process
